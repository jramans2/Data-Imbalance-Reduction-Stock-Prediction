Reduction in data imbalance for Enhanced Muti-head Parallel convolutional neural network based prediction of stock market prices from Social sentimental data
In this manuscript, An Accurate Multiple Data Based Stock Prediction and Sentiment Analysis Using Siamese graph convolutional attention network is proposed for accurately predict the stock market movement that is rising or falling.
Initially the input data is taken from two dataset, (stock market dataset and sentiment analysis dataset). In this, the stock market data is collected from NIFTY-50 Stock Market Data [1] and the sentiment analysis data is collected from the real time twitter data [23]. 
Then these two datasets are pre-processed with the help of light weight deep variable auto encoder for oversampling the imbalance data.
After pre-processing, the features of both data are fused with the help of hybrid  Snow Geese White Shark Optimizer Algorithm 
Finally Muti-head Parallel convolutional neural network accurately predict the stock market movement that is rising or falling. For improving the prediction accuracy and reducing error rate , Skill Optimization Algorithm is proposed
Then the proposed model is implemented in PYTHON platform and the performance of the proposed method is analyzed by evaluation metrics like Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1- Score, recall, false alarm rate, computational complexity and error rate.
